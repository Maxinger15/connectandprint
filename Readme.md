## Connect to your printer on fileupload

This plugin simply tries to connect octoprint to your printer if you upload a file.

If the connection is successful it will start the print.
If it canÂ´t connect for 2 minutes it will abort.

## PSU-Control
The plugin automatically identifies PSU-Control and will activate your printer through PSU-Control 
prior to initiating the printing process.
