## Connect to your printer on fileupload

This plugin simply tries to connect octoprint to your printer if you upload a file.

If the connection is successful it will start the print.
If it canÂ´t connect for 2 minutes it will abort.

## PSU-Control support
I am currently working on an PSU-Control integration.

Since I don't have a proper setup for that I need some help and feedback.

Please have a look at the Issue: [psu-control](https://github.com/Maxinger15/connectandprint/issues/5)
